# Pokemon EDA Kaggle

The Anime Pokemon doesn’t need any introduction but for the sake of this article, I do need to provide one. Pokémon has been a successful long-running Anime, with a huge fan following. An adventurous based story, that mainly focuses on 10-year-old Ash Ketchum, a young Pokémon Trainer from Pallet Town. Together with Pikachu, Ash set out on a daring journey where he battles with many Pokémon trainers. On their journey, they meet new friends and new rivals. From traveling around one gym to another and participating in many championships, Ash dreamt of becoming the World’s greatest Pokémon Master.

Pokemon is not just a popular Anime but also a popular Video Game. Not to forget Pokemon Go, which had a crazy hype in Moblie Gaming. With the vast Pokemons detail, performing EDA becomes even more interesting. 

# What Is EDA?

`EDA` stands for `Exploratory Data Analysis`. When provided with a dataset, you need to take data-driven steps to analyze the data. Using Python modules `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, you can perform EDA. EDA is more like the storytelling of the given dataset.

The more you understand the data, the better you analyze and visualize the dataset. You can try hands-on experience in Data Analysis and Data Visualisation in the following notebook. How cool is that?

One thing to keep in mind is you need to have basic Python Knowledge and how to import a module. Once done you can try out `Pokémon EDA` to get started with `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`.
